## Environmental predictors of bird species richness across the United States: a route-based spatial analysis

This is a code for the final assignement of Spatial Data Science for Social Geography course (see: https://martinfleischmann.net/sds/).

A route-based analysis of bird species richness across the contiguous United States, using BBS routes as the observational units and combination of environmental (NDVI) and spatial (elevation, LONG, LAT) predictors..


### Research objectives

Quantify spatial variation in bird species richness across the contiguous United States using BBS routes.

Evaluate spatial autocorrelation in species richness and model residuals.

Assess how NDVI and spatial factors predict species richness at the route level.

Try to use geographicaly weighted regression.
